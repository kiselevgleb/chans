This is good enough deal, but my impact driver and drill were both working well and buying new tools just to get new batteries seemed a little wasteful. A friend told me about Irina and I was pleased to hear that my batteries could be rebuilt. The rebuilt batteries would be at least as good as new and would not have to carried off for hazardous disposal. After a brief email exchange with Irina, my batteries were picked up and then delivered back in few days. Truthfully, the batteries seem better than new. They take, and hold, a full charge and my favorite tools have been granted a new lease. Apparently Irina can rebuild many types of rechargeable batteries including laptops and cordless vacuums. This is great service and a great reason not to put old batteries or expensive cordless tools into the landfill."

As I had met with refusals and hesitations from others who were closer, I emailed Chans to find whether they would be able to assist. The owner, Ms Irina Chulkova, wrote back and quoted a price of HALF of what I had been quoted previously. Needless to say, the batteries were packed and shipped the next day. After a quick turn around and email contacts to arrange return, I was delighted to finally be able to put this set back into use. The honesty and integrity of Ms. Chulkova was incredible."

I tell them about their quick service and the lower cost to rebuild as compared to the high cost of purchasing new replacement batteries"
