The table below shows the <b>approximate prices</b> for the rebuilt batteries with the capacities we can make. For example, in 36V 10Ah battery there can be from 40 till 60 cells. So we can make from 10Ah up to 15 Ah. using our 2.5Ah cells. The price doesn't include the BMS (Battery management System) if it is faulty and needs replacing. So far, as a small supplier, we don't charge the GST/HTS!</p><table className=\"tab\"><tr className=\"tr\"><td className=\"tb\">Voltage V </td><td colspan=\"3\">24</td><td colspan=\"4\">36</td><td colspan=\"4\">48</td></tr><tr className=\"tr\"><td className=\"tb\">Capacity Ah </td><td>10 </td><td>12.5</td><td>15</td><td>7.5</td><td>10</td><td>12.5</td><td>15</td><td>10</td><td>12.5</td><td>15</td></tr><tr className=\"tr tr-col\"><td className=\"tb\">$ CAD </td><td> 339.00 </td><td> 369.00 </td><td> 409.00 </td><td> 399.00 </td><td> 449.00 </td><td> 499.00 </td><td> 389.00 </td><td> 459.00 </td><td> 519.00 </td><td> 579.00 </td></tr></table>"
